The core data used for this study are also available [here](https://globalfishingwatch.org/data-download/datasets/public-vessel-identity:v20230118) and the methodology is described in detail in the [Supplementary Materials](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H-Fd0JfB5eDEKxn-h7sxH0Ci3eSIGg3F/view?usp=share_link) of the paper.  

## Setup

### Running scripts

1. Clone this repo by `git clone https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/paper-tracking-vessel-identity` 
2. You have all analysis scripts organized by theme under the `paper_tracking_vessel_identity` folder.
3. Follow the instructions in each folder.

### Environments

1. For Python scripts
  * Requirement: python >= 3.8.0 (see packages in detail radenv_videntity.yaml)
  * run `pip install -e .` to install the necessary packages. This will create a folder titled `<module>.egg-info` that will allow you to access the code within `paper_tracking_vessel_identity` folder from outside of that folder by doing `import <module>` without any need to use paths.
2. For R scripts, the tested R version is 3.6.3 


## Structure and descriptions

To learn more about this structure and how it is meant to be used throughout different stages of the project, see [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1E51s4VhcLzCwN_v_yeOpaGLtNEF5fcZanlO1lRsmGiw/edit?usp=sharing).

    |- README.md		<- Top-level README on how to use this repo
    |- data			    <- Data files. Create subfolders as necessary.
    |- docs			    <- Documentation.
    |- scripts		    <- Regular python and R files. These may use code from <module> but are not
    |				       notebooks. A good place for scripts that run data pipelines, train models, etc.
    |- outputs		    <- Models results, static reports, etc. Create  additional subfolders as necessary.
    |    |- figures	    <- Create versioned figures folders if desired.
    |- queries		    <- SQL files (.sql, .jinja2, etc). Create subfolders as necessary. When creating
    |				       new tables in BigQuery, be sure to use a schema with good field descriptions.
    |- setup.cfg		<- Needed for pip install of repo.
    |- setup.py		    <- Needed for pip install of repo.
    |- tests		    <- Unit tests.
    |- .gitignore	    <- Modify as necessary.
    |- .pre-commit-config.yaml	    <- Style linting using `pre-commit library. Must run `pre-commit
    |                                  install` once to turn on commit hook. Modify as necessary.
